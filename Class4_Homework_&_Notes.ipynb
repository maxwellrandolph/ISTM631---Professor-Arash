        "Answer: First instinct is to say we wouldn't. What would be the point of a loop did nothing but loop and end? I could see use of a loop that returns a value if nothing is found in the loop, such as referencing a variable outside the loop if a condition is met, but then this wouldn't be an empty loop. The purpose of a loop is to scan a string for the first occurance of the character. So a string that has no characters, would not have purpose other showing an infinite loop. An empty loop could be used to manually force the loop to stop(CNTR-C).\n",

        "*Answer:* While loops can be used to describe conditional iteration. They perform a certain task continuosly until a certain condition, precisely defined by the coder, is met. A while statement consists of a test condition(true or false), body of loop(test condition is tested continuiosly until condition is false), a count(# of time the loop occurs), and many other items based on the functionality of the loop. The while loop can bee thought of as a repeating if statement.\n"

        "*Answer*: I would like to know what words are correlated with the 'Number of tweets by hour', specifically what the trend is in the hours from hours 19-22. It might also be interesting to see what the trend of frequently used wording in these tweets and communication with other countries governement agencies. Our current president does not hold his toung, but I think it would be telling to see his underlying emotions through word use & count after speaking with other countries. We could compare the timing of the tweets with different locations among the world to predict emotional preference for that location, and compare those results to what he claims his preference to be.\n",

This would be beneficial because we could look at correlations in Trump's tweets and world events. We could compare his reactions to different world events and see if they had any correlation with events thereafter."
