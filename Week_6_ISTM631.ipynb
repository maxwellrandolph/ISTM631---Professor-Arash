She could use variables in her code rather than numbers, so she could easily reproduce the outcome without rewriting the equation. 2. Anne could slightly change the functionality of her code and additionally save more time. As an example Anne could easily change code from addition to multiplication rather than coding a new function. 3. Anne could add a piece of code that uses variables rather numbers to a larger piece of code that completes a larger task to simplify the process and save time."
